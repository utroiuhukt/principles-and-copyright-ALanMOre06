What are the "Four Freedoms" defined by the Free Software Foundation? 
The Four Freedoms are the basic rules for free software:
Freedom 1: You can use the software for any purpose.
Freedom 2: You can study how the software works and change it to fit your needs.
Freedom 3: You can share copies of the software with others.
Freedom 4: You can improve the software and share your improvements with everyone.

How does the GNU Manifesto justify the ethical importance of free software?
The GNU Manifesto says free software is important because:
Sharing is good: It helps people work together and build a community.
Freedom matters: Proprietary software controls what users can do, but free software gives users control.
It’s the right thing to do: Sharing software is like helping others, and it’s a way to be kind and fair.
No monopolies: Free software stops big companies from controlling everything.

What is the difference between "open source" and "free software"?
Free Software:
It’s about freedom (like free speech).
Users can use, change, and share the software however they want.
The goal is to make sure users have control over the software.

Open Source:
It’s about sharing the code so others can see and improve it.
The goal is to make better software through teamwork and transparency.
